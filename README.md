# arduino-wireless-wiichuck
Arduino wireless wii nunchuck code that works with the $5 yobo controller

### Usage
Connect A4, A5 to SDA, SCL and power with 3.3v. I used 2.2k pullup resistors on SDA and SCL because I used an arduino pro mini.

### Note
The was used on an 8MHz pro mini, you will need to change the CPU_FREQ variable if you use it on a 16MHz board.
